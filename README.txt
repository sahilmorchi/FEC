Functionality

The program can add, remove, and edit employees and customers from a database.

Every employee/customer have a name, ID, etc. You can save the data as an xml file

and load it up later if you choose to do so. New xml files can be created, and old ones

can be loaded.

Reports can be generated for customers attendance and the work schedule of employees.

Both reports can be printed and or exported as an excel .xls file.
